This is a repository of my **Personal Website** based on a single page Hugo template from [**Awesome Identity**](https://github.com/posquit0/hugo-awesome-identity). This Hugo template is extremely simple to use, with responsive layout to support any screen size. This template provides the capability to customize the overall theme layout, with the integration of **Google Analytics** and **Crisp** live chat services.
